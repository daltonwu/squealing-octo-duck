Aim: Canvassing the area.

HTML5!
	Redesign of HTML with a focus on making the more "modern" features of web
	browsers easy to work with.
	
	Designed around Javascript and a standardized DOM
		Document Object Model
			Model that organizes the components of a web page as a tree
			
			Provides an API to access the elements of a webpage via programming
			languages like Javascript
		
		Includes built-in support for audio and video playback.
		
		Includes an element that can be directly drawn on

Canvas
	HTML5 element that provides a drawing area.
	
	Javascript functions can draw onto a canvas element.
	
		You must declare what context you are drawing in. For example: 2D drawing,
		3D drawing, raw bitmap rendering …
	
	Basic canvas operation:
	
		HTML
			<canvas height="500" width="500" id="slate"></canvas>
		
		Javascript
			var c = document.getElementById("slate");
			var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
			
			ctx.fillStyle = "#f00";
			ctx.fillRect(50, 50, 100, 200);

Aim: Your path to success starts here!

Javascript path functions
	
	Paths are used to draw arbitrary shapes
	
	A context can keep track of one	path at a time
	
	The path is not drawn until stroke() is called
	
	A path is considered done when beginPath() is called again
	
	beginPath()
		Starts or resets the current path
	
	moveTo(x, y)
		Moves the path to position (x, y), does not result in a line or a
		filled in section
	
	lineTo(x, y)
		Moves the path to position (x, y), will result in a line or a filled in
		section
	
	closePath()
		Results in a line from the current position to the starting position
		
		The path can be continued after
	
	stroke()
		Renders all the lines in the path. Does not end the path
	
	fill()
		Fills the interior of the path. Will not work if the path has fewer
		than three points.

Aim: Let's animate!

What we won't be using
	setInterval

What we will be using
	requestAnimationFrame

Why?
	requestAnimationFrame tells the browser to run a specified function before
	drawing the next frame.
	
	The browser will attempt to run ≈60 frames per second or the display
	refresh rate (per W3C recommendation).
	
	It lets the browser handle when the code should be executed (as opposed to
	setInterval which is based on specific times). It also lets the browser
	pause animation when a page is not in the foreground.

Aim: What's your vector, Victor?

XML (EXtensible Markup Language)
	It is not a formatting language (like HTML)
	
	A framework for creating markup-based grammars
	
	Uses some of the syntactic standards of HTML, like tags and attributes,
	with a focus on storing and representing data instead of rendering and
	displaying it.
	
	An XML namespace is defined by the tags and attributes associated with a
	specific XML language.

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
	SVG is a specific XML-based vector graphics format.
	
	Vector graphics are images that are not represented as a 2D grid of pixels
	(raster), but instead as a list of drawing commands (like line, circle,
	rectangle, curve, …).
	
	Biggest advantage to vector graphics is that they are scalable to any size
	without resulting in pixelation.
	
	The <svg> element is designed to store SVG code (that is, SVG XML elements)
	
	xmlns
		Attribute that identifies the namespace for the specific XML language
		being used.
