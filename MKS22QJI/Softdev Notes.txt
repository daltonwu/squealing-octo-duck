Aim: Canvassing the area.

HTML5!
	Redesign of HTML with a focus on making the more "modern" features of web
	browsers easy to work with.
	
	Designed around Javascript and a standardized DOM
		Document Object Model
			Model that organizes the components of a web page as a tree
			
			Provides an API to access the elements of a webpage via programming
			languages like Javascript
		
		Includes built-in support for audio and video playback.
		
		Includes an element that can be directly drawn on

Canvas
	HTML5 element that provides a drawing area.
	
	Javascript functions can draw onto a canvas element.
	
		You must declare what context you are drawing in. For example: 2D drawing,
		3D drawing, raw bitmap rendering â€¦
	
	Basic canvas operation:
	
		HTML
			<canvas height="500" width="500" id="slate"></canvas>
		
		Javascript
			var c = document.getElementById("slate");
			var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
			
			ctx.fillStyle = "#f00";
			ctx.fillRect(50, 50, 100, 200);

Aim: Your path to success starts here!

Javascript path functions
	
	Paths are used to draw arbitrary shapes
	
	A context can keep track of one	path at a time
	
	The path is not drawn until stroke() is called
	
	A path is considered done when beginPath() is called again
	
	beginPath()
		Starts or resets the current path
	
	moveTo(x, y)
		Moves the path to position (x, y), does not result in a line or a
		filled in section
	
	lineTo(x, y)
		Moves the path to position (x, y), will result in a line or a filled in
		section
	
	closePath()
		Results in a line from the current position to the starting position
		
		The path can be continued after
	
	stroke()
		Renders all the lines in the path. Does not end the path
	
	fill()
		Fills the interior of the path. Will not work if the path has fewer
		than three points.
