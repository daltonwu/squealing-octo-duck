Aim: Time to C what we can do.

Do Now: What command line programs would do the following?
	(always assume you are starting at your home directory)
	
	1) Move foo.java from Desktop/ to Documents/
	2) Remove all .class files
	3) Connect to lisa.stuy.edu from someplace else
	4) Figure out what gcc does
	5) Copy woohoo.c from your home directory to a /code/ directory on homer (assume you are not working on homer itself)

Aim: C what I did there?

Do now:

	From yesterday:
		4) Figure out what gcc does
		5) Copy woohoo.c from your home directory to a /code/ directory on homer (assume you are not working on homer itself)
		
	Today:
		List the Java primitive variable types
		* byte
		* short
		* int
		* long
		* float
		* double
		* boolean
		* char
		
	Last Class Today!
	
		Every day, 1 student will be chosen at random to provide a recap of the previous day's class.
		
		That evening, the same person will be responsible for posting the notes to the class Piazza page. Make sure to tag the note as "last class today".
		
			Title the note LCT <MM/DD WEEKDAY>
			For example: LCT 9/10 Thursday
			
			Also include at the end of the note a link to an interesting piece of tech/science news.

Aim: Variables are the spice of life.

Do Now: What is the smallest variable type that could be used to store the following values (using standard sizes)?

	1) 5				byte
	2) -30,000			short
	3) 255				short
	4) 5,000,000,000	float
	
C Primitive Variable Types
	
	All C primitives are numeric.
	
	The only difference is floating point vs. integer and size of variable.
	
	Size can be platform dependent.
		sizeof(<TYPE>) can be used to find the size in bytes.
		
		sizeof(int)
		
	Types	Standard Size (bytes)
	int			4
	short		2
	long		8
	float		4
	double		8
	char		1
	
	All boolean values are numbers:
		0  == false
		!0 == true
		
		YOU WILL ALL MAKE THIS MISTAKE:
			if(x = 6) {…}

Aim: Always read the fine print.

Do Now: Open up your editor of choice (Emacs), write a basic "Hello, world!" program in Java.

Data Types and Variables
	
	Character literals are single characters inside ''.
		e.g., 'a', '*'
	
	String literals exist, even though there is no string data type.
		e.g., "hello", "you smell"
	
	Any variable type can be decalred an "unsigned" variable. This signifies the variable will never be negative.
		The lower bound of any unsigned variable is 0.
		The upper bound will be greater than the signed version.
		
		e.g.	unsigned char x;
				0 <= x <= 255

SoTD: "Superstitious" — Stevie Wonder
Aim: A vast array of possibilities.

Do Now: How do you declare/use arrays in Java?

Mentioned:
